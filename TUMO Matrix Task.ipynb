    "We are going to use Dynamic Programming. The idea for solving this is the following: We first build a table $m$, which is going to have length and height equal to the number of the elements. Then, we are going to take $i$, the rows, as a starting point, and $j$, the columns, as an ending point for our subsequences. So, we are going to find the find minimum of some subsequence, and check if that minimum is greater than or equal to the length of that subsequence. For example, our elements are [1,3,5]. We are taking the subsequence (1,2), meaning from the second to the third element. The minimum of that subsequence is 3, which is greater than 2; hence, we can draw there a square. In that fashion we are going to populate our table. As a way to increase performance, we can apply this stratefy: Since in the right upper corner of the table there will be small values, we can use early stopping, when the minimum element for a diagonal is less than the lenght of a subsequence (I know I may have explained it in a vague way, but try to read the code, pleaseðŸ˜„). Below there are all the versions of the algorithm, from the slowest to the fastest. "
